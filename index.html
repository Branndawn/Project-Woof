		<h1>Golden Retrievers</h1>
		<p>The Golden Retriever is the classic family companion. They are obedient, playful, intelligent and nice to strangers. They are good watchdogs, but make lousy guard dogs as they love meeting new people. Golden Retrievers are extremely obedient and are often the champions of sporting competitions. Hunters find them to be good hunting dogs with their keen sense of smell and desire to work alongside people. Golden Retrievers love people and are best suited for large, active families.</p>
